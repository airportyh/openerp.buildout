Installation
------------

This was tested under Ubuntu 11.04.

I know it's bad, but for convenience, all the commands below should be run as root.

1. Install system dependencies using your favorite package manager. Here is the
   example for an Ubuntu machine:

     $ apt-get install xxxxxxxxxxxxxx

2. Initialize the buildout environment:

     $ python ./bootstrap.py --distribute

3. Run buildout itself:

     $ ./bin/buildout

4. Launch the servers:

     $ /etc/init.d/postgresql restart
     $ su openerp -c "./bin/openerp-shell ./parts/openerp/server/openerp-server"
